## Motivation
I create this mini programs to help improve my programming skill and become familiar with Python programming language.
Feel free to give any suggestions or comments if you think this repository or my code need to be improved or simplified, or maybe you have an interesting idea that can be made.

## How It Can Benefit You
* *If you are a beginner,*

     Just like me, a newbie in coding, sometimes we need some simple examples 
     to learn more about the language or to see someone's perspective in solving the problems.
     It's also good for you who just want to try to read and understand other people's code,
     or maybe you can get some inspirations about what to make from this repository.

* *If you are not a beginner,*

     Improve your skill by helping us, a beginner, to write better codes.      
     Make the codes more efficient, or simpler.

## List of Programs
* [Reverse a String Program](https://github.com/annisanadia/simple-command-line-programs-in-python/blob/master/reverse_string.py) - 
Type a string, then the program will reverse the string and display it. If you type "-stop-" (without quotation mark), the program will stop.
